We develop optimization methods which would lead to the best wafer release policy in the chamber tool to maximize the overall yield of the wafers in semiconductor manufacturing system. Since chamber degradation will jeopardize wafer yields, chamber maintenance is taken into account for the wafer sequence decision-making process. Furthermore, genetic algorithm is modified for solving the scheduling problems in this paper. As results, it has been shown that job scheduling has to be managed based on the chamber degradation condition and maintenance activities to maximize overall wafer yield.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.hindawi.com/images/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://images.hindawi.com/images/social/MPE.jpg\",\"width\":1200,\"height\":630,\"aspectRatio\":0.525}}" %}

In particular, in this study we deal with the wafer probe process which requires several types of equipment with different capacities. As a connecting procedure of the fabrication and the assembly, the probe process may determine the capacity of whole semiconductor manufacturing. The throughput needs to be maximized as for most manufacturing lines. Because of unexpected machine failure and planned preventive maintenance, the utilization of machines has to be kept at a certain range for stabilizing the process. Hence, the production progress for each device and the utilization of machines are objectives to be maximized simultaneously, while both tend to work in opposite directions because of changeover time loss.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.tandfonline.com/favicon.ico\",\"aspectRatio\":0},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/cover-img/10.1080/095372800432124\",\"width\":110,\"height\":146,\"aspectRatio\":1.3272727272727274}}" %}
